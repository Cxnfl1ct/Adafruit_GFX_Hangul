[English](README.md) | [한국어](README_kr.md)

Library that adds support for printing Korean characters.

This library was intended to support UTF8 format but I had to make unique character format for the library.

## Overview

This library made to be able to run on low-spec MCUs by utilizing the method of putting texture of Consonants and Vowels together.
(This can be disabled in config)

If you disable Character Assembly Method, you will be able to choose from Combination font and Complete font.
